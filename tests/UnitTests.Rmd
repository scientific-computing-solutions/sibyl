# Unit Tests

Following the order of creation of objects as shown in the user guide:

* Testing the creation of the ColumnDef objects is found in test-columnDef.R
* The creation of the Survival Data object is tested in test-survivalData.R
* Checking errors are thrown when an invalid data frame/column definitions is used to create a SurvivalData object is tested in test-survivalData.R
* (minOfMaxObserved function - only used in Sibyl Shiny App is also tested in SurvivalData.R)
* The summary tables of the SurvivalData (covariates, subgroups, endpoints and covariates maturity) are tested in test-survivalDataOutput.R
* The testing of the functions to help with model fitting (extracting the correct subgroup, creating the correct model formula) is tested in test-helpFitting.R
* The creation of the semiParametric model (including errors when invalid object is attempted to be created) are tested in test-semiParametric.R
* The testing of the outputs aassociated with the semiParametric model (logrank test) and the extractCumHazData function (used to extract data out of the KM table) are tested in test-semiParametric.R
* The file test-survivalModels.R tests the creation of SurvivalModel objects and that errors are thrown when invalid models are attempted to be created
* The code used to generate the summary tables for parameter, var-covars and Cholesky are tested in test-summariseCoeffs.R and the code which tests the getDisplayRowNames function (used to get the correct names of coefficients in these tables) is tested in test-getDisplayRowNames.R
* test-icTable.R tests the creation of the AIC/BIC table
* test-lifeTable.R tests the creation of the life table
* test-averageCurvePlotData.R tests the creation of the avCurvePlotData object
* test-splineAIC.R tests the creation of the Spline AIC table
* test-rmst.R tests the creation of the parametric restricted mean table
* test-specificEndpointValidation.R tests the specificEndpointRules and getZeroTimes functions
* test-oneArm.R tests the package works with single arm trials

Note that the creation of the data frames/matrices used to generate the FlexTable objects have been unit tested but the FlexTable creations themselves have not been tested (FlexTables are rJava objects and not testable)
